  "body": "log4net.Ext.Json\r\n================\r\n\r\nWelcome to log4net.Ext.Json wiki! Check your [first steps] to start exploring the world of JSON logging. Consider [unique event stamps] or adding a [keep-alive appender] to keep your logs alive. To figure what to do with Arrangements, look at [Arrangement tests](https://github.com/robajz/log4net.Ext.Json.Tests/tree/master/Layout/Arrangements/). Check the [news] for latest gossips.\r\n\r\nThis log4net extension allows your .net applications to produce JSON formatted logs through the log4net framework. It is currently implemented and run as a separate DLL and project, but it could very well become a feature of log4net itself in the future.\r\n\r\nDownloads - The DLL is built against various log4net released/trunk versions in different .net frameworks. To safely identify the released log4net dll you use, make an md5sum of the binary and compare:\r\n\r\nmd5sum hash of log4net.dll        | build to use\r\n--------------------------------- | --------------------------\r\nb89cb7f3f1a1e2807e708f5435deb13d  | 1.2.10 oldkey net.2.0\r\n42e02f10d65701b1ff92a4937bb24ed7  | 1.2.11 oldkey net.2.0\r\n95b1db78784fa5968fa0c0615815a292  | 1.2.11 newkey net.2.0\r\n996047633a94d54149c0968185673ab9  | 1.2.11 newkey net.3.5\r\n4eb9b506b3454921782a60d40690ed37  | 1.2.13 newkey net.2.0\r\nf69c36bbf1220bdd2a114f4abc6b0fc1  | 1.2.13 newkey net.3.5\r\nf365257deaf2b5319beb47b84ac6cc25  | 1.2.13 newkey net.3.5.cp\r\n31e73af0734f4328879c1d96cdc4658c  | 1.2.13 newkey net.4.0\r\ntrunk is built afresh on release. | 1.3 trunk net.4.0\r\nif it's not on the list           | use one of the above or ask for a special build\r\n\r\nThe solution is unit-tested and bench-marked (bench-mark GUI included in source) against regular log4net, though it's still under development and it may show some quirks. Your feedback is most welcome and needed at this stage.
